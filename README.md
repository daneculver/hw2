### Programming Problem Notes

 For each programming problem, let us know:

 - How we should compile your code (`g++` command or `make` target)
type make to compile my program. 

 - Design decisions you made or other non-trivial choices for your implementation


 - Any additional tests you wrote and what files those exist in


 - Known errors/anything to help us grade (though we will run automated tests,
knowing what features may be broken/missing may help us provide some partial credit)
errors in mydatastore.cpp causing amazon.cpp not to run correctly.
